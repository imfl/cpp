## K-means

An implementation of K-means in C to solve the following classroom question.

Consider the following eight two-dimensional data points:

$$
x_1 (65, 60), x_2 (53, 60), x_3 (65, 62), x_4 (53, 64), x_5 (68, 63), x_6 (51, 57), x_7 (60, 51), x_8 (60, 80)
$$
You are required to show the information about each final cluster (including the mean of the cluster and all data points in this cluster) as the output of the algorithm. You can consider writing a program for this part but you are not required to submit the program.  

1.  If k = 2 and the initial means are (60, 51) and (60, 80), what is the output of the algorithm? 
2.  If k = 2 and the initial means are (53, 60) and (65, 60), what is the output of the algorithm? 
3.  If k = 3 and the initial means are (60, 51), (60, 80) and (53, 60), what is the output of the algorithm?
4.  If k = 4 and the initial means are (60, 51), (60, 80), (53, 60) and (65, 60), what is the output of the algorithm?
